## Hashing

---

## Password Re-use

- Most people re-use passwords across multiple sites

--

- Hackers that have gained access to password data from one site can use that to try to access your accounts on other sites

--

- As a developer of one of those _other_ sites, we can't do much about this

--

- We _can_, however, ensure that our site isn't the source of such compromised data

## Encryption

We often talk about data security using the term **encryption**. Encryption is a two-way operation. We apply an algorithm to encrypt a message, and that operation is reversible.

--

**Example**

```python
encrypt('The crow flies at midnight!', 16)
```

```nohighlight
> 'Jxu shem vbyui qj cytdywxj!'
```
--

```python
encrypt('Jxu shem vbyui qj cytdywxj!', 10)
```

```nohighlight
> 'The crow flies at midnight!'
```

---

## Downsides of Encryption

- Un-encrypting a message requires a **key**. If the key is compromised, all encrypted data becomes exposed.

--

- If a message is able to be un-encrypted, then anybody with the key can steal that information

---

## One-Way Hashing

An alternative to two-way encryption is **one-way hashing**

--

The idea behind hashing is that given a string, an algorithm can produce an output that is difficult to un-encrypt, but is still useful in uniquely determining the intent of the user.

--

Hashing is a technique that turns a string into an unintelligible, fixed-length string of characters that is in some sense unique.

```python
hashval = hash_func(msg)
```

---

## Characteristics of a Good Hash Function

- Speed: Since they will be used frequently, they should be very fast.

--

- Deterministic: Running the hash function multiple times with the same string should always produces the same result.

--

- Inversion-resistent: It should be very, very, very difficult (i.e. more-or-less impossible) to find a way to "reverse" the hashing process.

--

- Collision-resistent: It should be very, very, very rare that passing two different strings through the hash function will give the same result.

---

## Benefits of Hashing

- Site developers can't see or decrypt user passwords

--

- It's almost possible to "reverse" the hash, so even if a hacker is able to access an app's database, it is very difficult for them to determine user passwords

--

- Hashing still allows for verification

---

## How We Verify Passwords Using Hashes

Here's the rough idea:

```python
password = request.form['password']
pw_hash = user.pw_hash
if pw_hash == hash_func(password):
    return 'Correct password!'
else:
    return 'Incorrect password :('
```

---

## A Naive Hash Function

```python
ALPHABET = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

def alphabet_position(char):
    return ALPHABET.index(char.lower()) + 1

def hash(word):
    positions = [alphabet_position(char) for char in list(word)]
    return sum(positions)
```

---

## What's Good About This?

- It's fast

--

- It's impossible to reverse

--

- It's determinisitic (always produces the same result for a given string)

---

## What's Bad?

### Collisions!

```python
# returns 86
hash('LaunchCode')
```

--

Common words with the same hash value:

national, display, powered, works, lyrics, someone, mortgage, warning, republic, updates, respect, spanish, motion, fantasy, produced, lighting, brother, checkout, query, hunter, bookmark, printed, removal, newest, paragraph, symbol, mysql, relating, challenges, typical, formula, periods, memorial, cartoon, willing, drinking, measured, citizen, waters, pipeline, arthur, insight, terry, tokyo, johnny, recorder, firewall, receives, facilitate, seasonal, anybody, optimal, repairs, commander, weekends, signup, butter, recover, licenses,...

---

## A Hashing Vulnerability

The number of good hash functions in use is relatively small.

If a hacker steals your data and guesses which hash function you used, they can still figure out user passowrds using a **rainbow table**

---

## The Fix: Salts

For each password that we hash, we can tack on a random **salt** (a string of random characters) to make it much harder to use this brute-force approach

--

Here's the rough idea:

```python
password = request.form['password']
salt = get_salt()
pw_hash = hash_func(password + salt)
```
