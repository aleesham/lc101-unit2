- I will talk about Git branching and merging which are both important for our studio.

# What is CSS?

- The rules between tags versus tags with classes vs tags with ids. We will talk about this later

# Elements have default syles

# ID Selector

# Studio Walkthough
- We will work in pairs to create a story one sentence at a time. 
- Why GitHub (remote repositories) are important.
- I won't do any coding/initializing here as the directions are outlined very well. 
- Please find a partner in your groups. 
- If you have an odd number, have one person pair with another group with an odd number of people, or with a TF.
